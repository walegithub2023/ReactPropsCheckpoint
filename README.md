# NAME OF REPOSITORY: ReactPropsCheckpoint


# DESCRIPTION: A repository for ReactPropsCheckpoint. This repository houses a project made using React create-react-app command. The following are steps/instructions used to create the project.


Create a project using create-react-app.

Create a file called players.js, which is going to have an array of JSON Objects containing the player’s details (At least four players)
·        Be creative with your chosen players; you can choose whomever you like!

·        The attributes for each player are name, team, nationality, jerseyNumber, age, and an Image URL for the player.

·        Create a file called Player.js which contains the player component.

·        The Player component must render a react-bootstrap card. The card will display all attributes for each player defined in the players.js.

·        De-structure all the attributes for the Player component.

·        Create a component called PlayersList.js

·        Import inside the PlayerList.js, the Player component and the players’ data from players.js

·        Display all players inside the PlayerList.js, by mapping through all the elements in the array of players (check the .map function)

·        While mapping through the players pass in the props to the Player component (Search for the spread operator if you would like to use it)

·        Don’t forget to define default props for each attribute (Feel free to define any default props)

·        Use some inline styling for the Player component.

·        Import the PlayerList.js into the App.js (root component), and render the PlayerList.



# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
